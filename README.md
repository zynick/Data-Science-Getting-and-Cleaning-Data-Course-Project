This repo was created due to my journey of learning Data Science in John Hopkin's Online Data Science Course

## Data Source

Data source is available [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).


## run_analysis.R

The script consists of one function `runAnalysis()` that does all the requirement as requested in this Project.

To run the script, type:
```
source('run_analysis.R')
runAnalysis()
```

## CodeBook.md

Describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that is performed to clean up the data.


## tidy.txt

A tidy data set generated after `runAnalysis()` is performed.
